  # Bind a JSON schema to an Entity.
  # Bind a JSON schema to an Entity. The bound schema will be used to validate the Entity&#39;&#39;s metadata (annotations). Any child Entity that does not have a bound schema will inherit the first bound schema found in its hierarchy.  Only a single schema can be bound to an Entity at a time. If you have more than one schema to bind to an Entity you will need to create and bind a single composition schema using keywords such as &#39;anyOf&#39;, &#39;allOf&#39; or &#39;oneOf&#39; that defines how the schemas should be used for validation.  Note: The caller must be granted the UPDATE ermission on the Entity to bind.
