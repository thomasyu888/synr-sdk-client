Any child Entity that does not have a bound schema will inherit the first bound schema found in its hierarchy.  Only a single schema can be bound to an Entity at a time. If you have more than one schema to bind to an Entity you will need to create and bind a single composition schema using keywords such as &#39;anyOf&#39;, &#39;allOf&#39; or &#39;oneOf&#39; that defines how the schemas should be used for validation.

  # Update an entity.
  # Update an entity.  &lt;p&gt;  If the Entity is a FileEntity and the dataFileHandleId fields is set to a new value, then a new version will automatically be created for this update if the MD5 of the new file handle does not match the MD5 of the existing file handle or if the file handles do not have an MD5 set. You can also force the creation of a new version using the newVersion parameter  (see below).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  Synapse employs an Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) scheme to handle concurrent updates. Each time an Entity is updated a new etag will be issued to the Entity. When an update is request, Synapse will compare the etag of the passed Entity with the current etag of the Entity. If the etags do not match, then the update will be rejected with a PRECONDITION_FAILED (412) response. When this occurs the caller should get the latest copy of the Entity (see: &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;${GET.entity.id}\&quot;&gt;GET /entity/{id}&lt;/a&gt;) and re-apply any changes to the object, then re-attempt the Entity update. This ensure the caller has any changes applied by other users before applying their own changes.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  Note: To update an Entity the caller must be granted the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.ACCESS_TYPE}\&quot;&gt;ACCESS_TYPE.UPDATE&lt;/a&gt; on the Entity.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Service Limits&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;table border&#x3D;\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;th&gt;resource&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;limit&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;The maximum number of children for a single parent entity&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;10 K&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
