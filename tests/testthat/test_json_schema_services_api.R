  # Start an asynchronous job to create a new JSON schema.
  # Start an asynchronous job to create a new JSON schema. A JSON schema must include an $id that is a relative URL of that schema. The pseudo-BNF syntax for a valid $id is as follows:  &lt; $id &gt; ::&#x3D; &lt; organization name &gt; \&quot;-\&quot; &lt; schema name &gt; [ \&quot;-\&quot;  &lt; semantic version &gt; ]  &lt; organization name &gt; ::&#x3D; &lt; dot separated alpha numeric &gt;   &lt; schema name &gt; ::&#x3D; &lt; dot separated alpha numeric &gt;  &lt; semantic version &gt; ::&#x3D; See: https://semver.org/  &lt; dot separated alpha numeric &gt; :: &#x3D; &lt; alpha numeric &gt; ( \&quot;.\&quot; &lt; alpha numeric &gt; )*  &lt; alpha numeric &gt; ::&#x3D; &lt; letter &gt; ( &lt; identifier &gt; )*  &lt; letter &gt; ::&#x3D; [a-zA-Z]  &lt; identifier &gt; ::&#x3D; &lt; letter &gt; | &lt; digit &gt;  &lt; digit &gt; :: &#x3D; [0-9]  Take the following example, if organizationName&#x3D;\&quot;my.organization\&quot;, schemaName&#x3D;\&quot;foo.Bar.json\&quot;, and semanticVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0.1.2\&quot;, then $id&#x3D;\&quot;my.organization-foo.Bar.json-0.1.2\&quot;. Note: The semantic version is optional. When provide the semantic version is a label for a specific version that allows other schemas to reference it by its version. When a semantic version is include, that version of the schema is immutable. This means if a semantic version is included in a registered schema&#39;s $id, all $refs within the schema must also include a semantic version.  All $ref within a JSON schema must either be references to \&quot;definitions\&quot; within the schema or references other registered JSON schemas. References to non-registered schemas is not currently supported. To reference a registered schema $ref should equal the $id of the referenced schema. To reference the example schema from above use $ref&#x3D;\&quot;my.organization-foo.Bar.json-0.1.2\&quot;.  Note: The semantic version of a referenced schema is optional. When the semantic version is excluded in a $ref the reference is assumed to reference the latest version of the schema. So $ref&#x3D;\&quot;my.organization-foo.Bar.json\&quot; would be a reference to the latest version of that schema. While $ref&#x3D;\&quot;my.organization-foo.Bar.json-0.1.2\&quot; would be a reference to the version 0.1.2  To monitor the progress of the job and to get the final results use: GET /schema/type/create/async/get/{asyncToken}  Note: The caller must be granted the CREATE permission on the Organization in the schema&#39;s $id.
