  # Moves an entity and its descendants out of the trash can to a new parent.  NOTE:  This operation cannot be completed if the original parent has been deleted (unless the caller is a member of the Synapse Access and Compliance Team). The service will return a NotFoundException.  This is because of the potential security hole arising from allowing access requirements on folders:  If an entity is in a restricted folder and then deleted, it cannot be restored unless the new parent has the same restriction level as the original one.
